##React Code Test
####AJ Srivastava

###Overview
In the app you're provided a JSON object with a list of requests.
Using React, we want to do a few simple things.

###Requirements
- There should be a select dropdown with filter options. When a filter is selected, show appropriate requests.
- When the status is clicked, a select dropdown should open up to modify the status. It does NOT need to modify state or the original object.
- Use either React-Bootstrap npm package or standard Bootstrap CSS
- Use momentjs to format the date to whatever you like

###Usage
- Clone the repository
- Use `npm install` to install dependencies (Redux is included but not used)
- Use `npm run dev` to compile into bundle
- Open index.html to view app
